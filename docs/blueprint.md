# **App Name**: BreatheEasy

## Core Features:

- Breathing Timer: Implement a timer to count down the seconds for each phase (inhale, hold, exhale).
- Audio Prompts: Use speech synthesis to prompt the user at each phase: "Breath in", "Hold breadth", and "Breadth out".
- Loop Counter: Create a loop counter to track the number of completed loops and remaining loops (out of 10 total).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calming blue (#B0E2FF) to promote relaxation.
- Secondary color: Soft gray (#E0E0E0) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for the start button and loop counter display.
- Clean and simple layout with a focus on the timer display.
- Subtle breathing animation or color change on the circular timer to guide the user.
- Use simple, clear icons for the start/stop button.
